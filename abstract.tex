 Eye tracking is a process of detecting, observing, and analyzing eye movements and its behavior. It utilizes an image capturing system that makes use of a developed algorithm for pupil detection and gaze estimation.  The images will be captured using an RGB-D camera. The choice of camera is the Microsoft Kinect which can work with MATLAB software and MyRio. Nowadays, this technology is becoming ubiquitous due to its growing number of applications. One of which is being able to analyze driver awareness and the possibility of preventing road accidents caused by fatigue and drowsiness. A carefully designed prototype that detects several levels of drowsiness will be mounted on strategic locations that is optimal for data collection and analysis. The levels of drowsiness will be characterized by the time the driverâ€™s eyelids are closed, number of blinks, and pupil movements. Moreover, the said levels are based on psychological and scientific researches. The prototype will be tested based on the accuracy of an alarm system that also has different levels of notifying the drivers as well as the passengers.
