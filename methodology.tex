Mention here your methodology flow through a figure (preferably) and provide an overview of it and how your methodology achieves your objectives.  How your methodology achieves each of your specific objective is what your panelists/examiners will be looking for. 
Also make sure that you refer clearly to the chapters on the Literature Review, Theoretical Considerations, and Design Considerations showing how your methodology ties with those that you have discussed in those chapters.


\section{Implementation}

Summarize the process used to create/set-up the work with an explanation of such process, instruments, and materials that you used if any. If the description is lengthy, use condensed bullet points. 

\noindent \textit{Rule of thumb}: Implementation is how you made your  work; (keywords: implemented, created, made, soldered, programmed, etc.).

If you wrote a program or made a simulation, you must state how the program or simulation functions in this section.	An algorithm or a pseudocode as shown in Table~\ref{tab:calcxn} is a good example.

\section{Evaluation}

Describe the procedures for evaluating the correct behavior and outcome of your  work, including what information you need to gather and how you will obtain or measure it.  

\textit{Rule of thumb}: Evaluation is how you tested your  work; (keywords: measured, tested, compared, simulated, etc.).
